# STM32H750B-DK Minesweepwe

## Project summary
This is a project for subject "Organizacija raƒçunalnikov". 
The goal of my project was to make a game for STM32H750B-DK using the LCD and touch screen in C/C++. I crated Minesweepwe, I tried to make it as simmular to the origila, all of the assets are made with the included library with no use of any bitmaps or images.

## How to load it in the board 
### 1. ExtMen_Boot
First thing to do, get ExtMem_Boot project form [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/STM32CubeH7/tree/master/Projects/STM32H750B-DK/Templates). This is necessary to load the game in the board, it will let you load programs to memory and run the from it. 

1. Load the program in your project manager
2. Build and load it on the board as per usual


### 2. LTDC_Paint

I created the game from an example LTDC_Paint hence why the name. The code is changed dramaticly in my game but it uses the same libraries. 

1. Load the program in your project manager
2. Build the project 

You might need to to select the external load when loading the project. When the Debug Configurations window opens you go under the Debugger tab adn find External Loder. Pres Scan and the options should appear, select the one who has in the name MT25TL01G_STM32H750B-DISCO.

## About the project

### Initialization

In the main.c ``` int main()``` function all the necessary attribta are configured and functions initialized. The LCD and Touchscreen are initialized there witch are the main way of interacting with the game. After initialization in the infinit loop the ```sweeperMain(); ``` is called to begin the game.

All code for the game is located in the Minesweeper. The ```sweeperMain.h``` is the header file. In ```sweeperMain.c``` all the code is located. In ``` sweeperMain()``` the game is initialized, all the necessary parameters are set, and the bombs are palcet randomy on the map(23*11). 
The numbers around the bombs are generated using ```Set_Bomb_Number();```function it goes and looks at every non bomb tile and checks for all the bombs around. 
Then in the ```while(1)``` loop where we have 4 game modes. This is just to know what actions can the player make. There are 2 main modes Game mode when ```Game_State == 1``` is the time the player is actualy playing the game. ```Game_State == 2``` is when the player is selecting the bomb amount. ```Game_State == -1``` is just to breake the infinet loop in ```sweeperMain(); ``` so it restarts. ```Game_State == 4``` is the winner screen when you succesfuly open all the non bomb tiles.


## Game mechanics  
When you are playing the game there is a bomb counter in the top right of the screen that shows you how many bombs there are left. Next to it is a flag icon that indicates whether you open a tile or mark it as a bomb you can toggle between a pres on the icon. When the Read border is around the icon you will mark tiles and bombs otherwise you will open it. The happy yellow face in the middle of the screen is to reset. In the right hand side of the screen there is a time counter so you can track how long does it take you to compleat the game. 
When you open the manue for bomb selection anumber pad will appear and you will be able to input the number of bombs. If you make a mistake you can clear the number with CLR button or press OK to confirm and start the game again. There is a limit of 252 bombs becouse of the number of tiles and a bottom limit of 1. The number of tiles isnt adjustable becouse the screen is a fixed size and more tiles would make it harder to hit the right one becouse of the size of an individual tile.
If you unlock all the tiles succesfuly you win be granted a Viscory screen, you can press on the happy face to restart and play again.
